Roald was, around the year 1450, Lawman (or Lawspeaker) of the Faroe Islands.
Little is known about Roald, apart from that he had a farm in Dalur, and that he probably originated from Shetland.
In G.V.C. Young's textbook, Færøerne – fra vikingetiden til reformationen, Roald is not named. However, in the Lagting's official list of First Ministers, he is included.
